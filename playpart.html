           <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>  

            <p>[Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:]</p><p>Well, is
                that you?</p> 
    
            
            <h5>KAIA.</h5>
            
            <p>I merely wished to let you know that I have come.</p>
            <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>

            <p>[Indifferently.]</p> <p>I just happened to recollect her.
            </p>

            <h5>MRS. SOLNESS.</h5>

            <p>Miss Wangle was up long ago.</p>
        
            <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
            
            <p>How is the old man to-day?</p>
        
            
            
            <h5>KAIA.</h5>
            
            <p>Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
                to-day.</p>
           
            
            <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
            
            <p>Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.</p>
            <h5>KAIA</h5>

            <p> Yes</p> <p>[Pauses at the door.]</p> <p>Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?</p>

           <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>

           <p>No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.</p>

           <p>[KAIA goes out again to the left].</p>  <p>SOLNESS remains seated,
            turning over the drawings.</p>
