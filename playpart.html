            SOLNESS.

            [Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
            that you?
        <br>
            
            KAIA.
            
            I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
        </br>
        <br>
            
            SOLNESS.
            
            Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
        </br>
        <br>   
            
            KAIA.
            
            No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
            coming presently to hear--
        </br>    
        <br>   
            SOLNESS.
            
            How is the old man to-day?
        </br>
        <br>
            
            
            KAIA.
            
            Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
            to-day.
        </br>
        <br>    
            
            SOLNESS.
            
            Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
