    <h1>KaranamGopichand acts in a play</h1>
    <h2>The master building Act3  by Author Henrik Ibsen</h2>
        <p>
            SOLNESS.

            [Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
            that you?
        <br>
            
            KAIA.
            
            I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
        <br>
            
            SOLNESS.
            
            Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
        <br>   
            
            KAIA.
            
            No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
            coming presently to hear--    
        <br>   
            SOLNESS.
            
            How is the old man to-day?
        <br>
            
            
            KAIA.
            
            Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
            to-day.
        <br>    
            
            SOLNESS.
            
            Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
            KAIA.

           Yes. [Pauses at the door.] Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?

        <br>
           SOLNESS.

           No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.

           [KAIA goes out again to the left.  SOLNESS remains seated,
           turning over the drawings.
        <br>



           MRS. SOLNESS.

          [Over beside the plants.] I wonder if he isn't going to die now, as
          well?
        <br>



          SOLNESS.

          [Looks up at her.] As well as who?
        <br>
        


          MRS. SOLNESS.

          [Without answering.] Yes, yes--depend upon it, Halvard, old Brovik is
          going to die too. You'll see that he will.
        <br>



         SOLNESS.

         My dear Aline, ought you not to go out for a little walk?
        <br>



         MRS. SOLNESS.

         Yes, I suppose I ought to.

         [She continues to attend the flowers.
